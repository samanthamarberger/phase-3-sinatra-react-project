# Project 3: Your Body, Your Workouts #

### Description ###

Hello we developers! Welcome to "Your body, Your Workouts" web application. This is a single page web application that I built using REACT js for the front end, and Sinatra for my server. This single page application allows its user to view various workouts depending upon the muscle group they want to target. The user can add muscle groups, and add, delete, or edit workouts.

### Setup Instructions ###

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run bundle install to install the necessary gems
* Start up your server by running 
     ```bash
      bundle exec rake server 
* You will be able to find the server at 
      http://localhost:9292/muscle_groups
  
* Open the [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/samanthamarberger/my-final-phase-3-frontend-project)
* Fork and clone the frontend repository 
* In terminal run 
    ```
        npm install
        npm install react-router-dom
        npm start
    ```
* Browse the web application! 

### Application Purpose ###
This web application allows the user to look at and add muscle groups and their associated exercises. the user can also add edit and delete exercises. There is a NavBar at the top that allows the user to toggle between the Home page and the Muscle Groups page.

It is still in the growing process. I hope to add more functionality to it in the future, such as:
* Adding a stretches component so that the user can find stretches based off of a muscle group
* Allow the how to do's to be put in as steps in an array and output in a numbered list.
* How to videos so that the user of the application can get a better idea of proper form.
